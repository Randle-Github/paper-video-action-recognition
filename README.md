# paper-video-action-recognition

This is the repository of Randle's paper in video action recognition.

In this repository, following the advice of my mentor, I create this repository to record what I read and give a general description about this area. I mainly divide this area into *general video understanding* and *interaction*(human-object detection, compositional action recognition).
